    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
    99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. 
These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
 The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js
